Rick and Morty Info Hub

This android application acts as an information hub for the characters in a popular cartoon called Rick and Morty. It displays images using Glide and other information that was fetched from an API. The app utilizes dependency injection with Dagger, http requests with Retrofit and a Coroutine service, and a local Room database to populate information when the application does not have network connection.
